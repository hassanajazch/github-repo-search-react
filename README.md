# Github Repo Search - React

## Development:

* I have implemented built repo search application using react 
* I have used React Hooks for building components.
* Use component based approach. All components are inside src/components. And write Github API call as service inside src/services
* Write unit test using JEST

#### Running Step
- Install node v12.18.0
- Install Node packages - `npm install`
- Run unit test - `npm start`
- Run unit test - `npm run test`


#### Code Style
- Perfectly follow Single Responsibility rule
- Add `prettier` to keep code ident
- Use `ESLint` to follow patterns and standards of JavaScript
- Use TRY - Catch for error handling

#### Testing
- I have used `JEST` for testing
- Use AAA pattern for writing unit test (Arrange, Act, Assert)
